# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-with-Neural-Network
# Overview
This repository contains the code for my handwritten digit classification project using dense neural networks. The project's goal was to build an accurate and efficient model capable of recognizing and classifying handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9.

# Dataset
I used the popular MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The dataset contains 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples, making it an ideal choice for training and evaluating the model.

# Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed before running the code:
Python 3.x
and TensorFlow (or any other deep learning library of your choice).
# Model Architecture
The neural network architecture consists of dense (fully connected) layers. It takes a flattened input of 784 features (28x28 pixels) and consists of multiple hidden layers with customizable sizes. The final output layer has 10 units, one for each digit, to perform multi-class classification.

# Results
The model achieved an impressive accuracy of 97% on the test set, showcasing its ability to accurately classify handwritten digits.
